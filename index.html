           <p>My love, you did not deserve the treatment and anger you received last night. Such rash and irresponsible behavior is a failure on my part, especially with recent events calling into question my ability to act and think rationally.
               There is no excuse nor reason to behave the way that I did last night and I am not going to make excuses. I was wrong. I said horrible things to you that I will always regret. Things that I know aren't easy to take back. I only wish
               I could take it back, because they are so untrue. You are the greatest woman on this planet and I love you dearly. I'm so sorry, Jasmine. Please, forgive me and stay with me. Please.
           </p>

       <h2><b>Why This Will Not Happen Again</b></h2>

       <div class="list">
           <ul>
               <li>In the future, when time is needed I will specify how much.</li>
               <li>The time needed will reflect the severity of the situation.</li>
               <li>Speaking to you the way I did made me feel inhuman, like my father, and it broke and breaks my heart to know I directed those words towards you. 
                   My resolve to never utter a single thing like that towards you again will not be shaken even during the most intense arguments, no matter the circumstance.
